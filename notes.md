# Always Already Social: Issues & Opportunities in Archiving Social Media

## Abstract

For centuries archives have acquired, preserved and provided access to many
kinds of records that were generated as part of social transactions. So why do
we think of archiving social media as something that is so fundamentally
different and new? Part of the reason for this discontinuity can be found in the
decentralized architecture of the web itself, and its increasing consolidation
into platforms for surveillance capitalism, that doubly serve as sites for state
control. This presentation will explore these themes by examining some recent
trends in social media archiving, particularly as they relate to the experiences
of the Documenting the Now project. These themes suggest that a return to
archival concerns such as consent, community, and social justice can help ground
this archival work going forward.

Booms. The documentary heritage should be formed according to an archival
conception, historically assessed, which reflects the consciousness of the
particular period for which the archives is responsible and from which  the
source material to be appraised is taken.

social media as archival signal data

all sorts of problems with this (bias, disinformation, etc) but that's our job.

Cite Ricky and Michelle's work to highlight how archives have been engaged with
social justice work for a long time -- its. Ot something new.

Also Marika's critique of neoliberalism and why it is a useful lens for thinking
about the goals and aims of social media platforms and the goals of surveillance
capitalism. Efforts to displace the need for archiving on the individual serves
the purposes of neoliberalism.

archiveteam & internetarchive archiving Google+ and Tumblr, ethical
considerations of doing this. they choose to do particular sites, why these?

are social media platforms sustainable? what are we sustaining when we keep
something like FB online? What economic forces, and accumulations of capital
have been assembled to make FB work? Do we need to start thinking of more
sustainable and distributed social media platforms like Mastodon or Scuttlebutt?
There is some degree of sustainability that comes with centralization.

problems of abuse on these distributed platforms is potentially worse, but then
again who decides what is abuse?

Things Catalan archivists can do:

* hold social media platforms accountable for decent export options
* cultivate relationships with people & orgranizations who want to presere their
  social media
* design & participate in new collaborative social media systems
